## 💡 Inspiration

Many people struggling with mental health issues find it hard to stay motivated or track healthy habits.  
We wanted to make something that feels **comforting, simple, and supportive** — not overwhelming.  

That’s how **Olaf** was born — a friendly **seal talisman 🦭** that helps users set realistic goals like:
- Walking 10,000 steps  
- Eating 2,000 calories  
- Drinking 2 liters of water  
- Sleeping 8 hours  

Olaf celebrates progress, encourages balance, and reminds users that every small step counts 💙.
